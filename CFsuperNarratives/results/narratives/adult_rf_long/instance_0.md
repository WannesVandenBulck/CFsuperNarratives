## Counterfactual super narrative

The model currently predicts that this 18‑year‑old married man, with an education level of 9, working 20 hours per week and having no capital gains or losses, is likely to have an annual income at or below 50,000 USD. In total, 15 alternative “what if” scenarios (counterfactuals) were generated to see what kinds of changes would make the model predict an income above 50,000 USD instead. Across these 15 scenarios, the prediction changed to higher income in 13 cases (about 86.7%), and stayed at lower income in 2 cases (about 13.3%), which helps show which changes the model finds convincing. Looking at all 15 scenarios, the person’s education level was increased in 4 of them (about 26.7%), always to a higher value than the current level of 9, with an average increase of 4.0 education points among those that changed. Hours worked per week changed in 8 of the 15 scenarios (about 53.3%), and whenever it changed it always went up from 20 hours, with an average increase of about 35.9 hours per week among those that changed, suggesting the model strongly links much longer working hours with higher income. Capital gains changed in 14 out of 15 scenarios (about 93.3%), and in every case they increased from 0 to a positive amount, with an average increase of about 57,600 USD per year among those that changed, making capital gains the most consistently adjusted factor. Capital losses never changed in any of the scenarios, which suggests that, for this person, the model’s decision is driven much more by gains than by losses. Marital status changed in 3 of the 15 scenarios (20%), always from married to not married, but in one of those cases the prediction still stayed at lower income, so changing marital status alone is not a reliable way to flip the prediction. When the prediction did change to higher income, it almost always involved a substantial increase in capital gains, often combined with either more hours worked per week or a higher education level, or both. For this person, the most actionable insight is that the model associates moving into the higher‑income group mainly with building up significant capital gains, for example through investments or other sources of capital income. In addition, the model tends to see working many more hours per week as another strong signal of higher income, so increasing hours worked substantially is another pathway it considers important. Improving education level also appears helpful, though it is suggested less often than increasing capital gains or hours worked, and in the scenarios it always involved moving to clearly higher education levels. Changing marital status appears much less influential and, on its own, does not consistently lead to a higher‑income prediction in these examples. Overall, the clearest pattern is that large increases in capital gains, often together with much longer working hours and sometimes higher education, are what most reliably move the model’s prediction from income at or below 50,000 USD to above 50,000 USD for someone in this situation.
